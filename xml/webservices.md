What is a Web Service?

A web service is a web-based functionality accessed using the protocols of the web to be used by the web applications and uses standard XML Messaging for communication.

XML is used to encode all communications to a Web service. For example, a client invokes a Web service by sending an XML message, then waits for a corresponding XML response. Because all communication is in XML, Web services are not tied to any one operating system or programming.
