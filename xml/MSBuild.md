##### Section | MSBuild and the Project File


```MSBuild project files are based on the MSBuild XML schema, and as a result the build process is entirely open and transparent. In addition, you don't need to install Visual Studio in order to use the MSBuild engineâ€”the MSBuild.exe executable is part of the .NET Framework, and you can run it from a command prompt. As a developer, you can craft your own MSBuild project files, using the MSBuild XML schema, to impose sophisticated and fine-grained control over how your projects are built and deployed. These custom project files work in exactly the same way as the project files that Visual Studio generates automatically.```
