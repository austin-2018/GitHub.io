## SMS

### WinIoT Receive SMS, Get signal bars GSM network
#### Hi Morten, I have merged your question into an existing thread on the same topic.  Essentially the subsystem required for full SMS support is missing in IOT Core.  The suggestion is that you create a feedback item with your device usage scenario for the IoT Core team to evaluate and add to their work item backlog.

### Sending SMS And Email From Your IoT Device
#### Phone notifications are a good way to get alerted about an unusual activity. When we are developing an IoT solution it is always good to send SMS to user’s phone for certain activity as the smartphones are always within reach. It is not always possible for a user to monitor the data with a Mobile app or a website. If they get a notification about a certain activity or a sudden variation in data they will come to know this by time and can immediately check it with the mobile app and can take the further steps.
