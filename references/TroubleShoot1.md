##### No kernel
##### Reformated the SD card second time.
##### Above problem initially solved by adding Ehternet cable.  But after shutting off the same thing happened again, even with Ethernet cable. Tried to add wireless, but supossedly this already has Bluetooth and should not be needed.  Reformatted SD card a third time, in Drive F. 
##### NOTE WHEN INSTALLING: file system is NTFS
##### Says I need to format Drive J before using
##### Says I need to format Drive H before using
##### Says I need to format Drive I before using
##### Reformatting to FAT File system in Drive I

### Repair Drive F
