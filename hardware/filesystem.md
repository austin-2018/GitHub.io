### CARDS
``` For Windows, only certain micro SD cards are “Microsoft Verified“. I don’t pretend to understand the underlying differences between brands, but my experiences were that:```

1. a Kingston 64GB SDXC didn’t work for me,
1. a SanDisk 64GB SDXC didn’t work for me,
1. a SanDisk 16GB Ultra SDHC did work (which is Microsoft Verified), and
1. a SanDisk 8GB Ultra SDHC did work in certain circumstances (and this card is not Microsoft Verified).

### CONFIGURATION

``` For Windows 10 to run on the Pi 3, you must format your card as FAT32 – it won’t work if it’s formatted as NTFS, or exFAT.```
