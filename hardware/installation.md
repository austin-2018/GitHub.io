# YOU NEED PATIENCE

``` For a Windows 10 IoT install, I needed to be able to directly connect my Pi to an ethernet port.```

```First I tried the SanDisk 16GB SDHC Ultra (Microsoft Verified) – successful
For this disk, I decided to try to use “NOOBS Lite” to install Windows. For anyone who doesn’t know what NOOBS is, this is a piece of software which you can download, unzip, and copy to the root of your micro SD card. Then you can insert this SD card into your Raspberry Pi 3, power it up, and see a selection of operating systems which are available for download and install.```

```The steps I followed were:```
1. Format the 16GB disk as FAT32;
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi 3 to your router using a CAT5 cable;
1. Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry Pi 3 ;
1. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi 3;
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi 3 to a display device using an HDMI cable;
1. Finally, connect it to power using a powered USB socket (ideally delivering 5v and 1A, or better).
