### NOTES FROM The Legal Side of Open Source

#### https://opensource.guide/legal/
###### Note 1
```A standardized license serves as a proxy for those without legal training to know precisely what they can and can’t do with the software. Unless absolutely required, avoid custom, modified, or non-standard terms, which will serve as a barrier to downstream use of the agency code.```
```— @benbalter, “Everything a government attorney needs to know about open source software licensing” ```
###### Note 2
``` Common permissive licenses include MIT, Apache 2.0, ISC, and BSD. ```
