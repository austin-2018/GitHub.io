# Windows IoT Connect your device to the cloud

#### Excerpt
``` For devices that donâ€™t have a TPM chip, the tool can install a software-emulated TPM. This does not provide security but allows you to develop your app using a maker device (such as Raspberry Pi 2 or 3) and have security "light up" on a device with the hardware TPM without having to change the app. ```
