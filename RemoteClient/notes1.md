##### Notes May 5, 2018
##### Note 1:  Using Windows IoT Core Dashboard found device after two closes.
##### Note 2: Opening Windows Remote Client killed the connection
##### Note 3: Had to restart to reset the availability of the Windows IoT Core Dashboard; I think processes from the remote client were killing it.
