#### Title: Temperature Sensor Monitors Ambient Temperature
##### Description: Temperature Sensor Monitors Ambient Temperature, but a "heartbeat" must be included. A temperature taken once is no good if the temperature rises; regular, frequent sampling is needed. To that end, we must need a "timing" feature added.

#### Tasks
##### Run A loop for Temperature Check
##### Incorporate a "heartbeat" through a clock
