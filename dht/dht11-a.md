##### Excerpts
#### Library
#####The library I created is a simple refactoring of the code originally posted by Microsoft so I take no credit for the work done to get the sensor reading.

#### The library presents a simple *class* called *Dht11* in the *namesapace* *Sensors.Dht.* 
##### Creating a new object in C# is simple.
1. First open the GPIO pin you have the DHT11 sensor pin connected.

using Sensors.Dht;
GpioPin pin = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(4, GpioSharingMode.Exclusive);
