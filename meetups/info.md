``` .NET Core on a Raspberry Pi Cluster with Docker and OpenFaaS```

```Wondering what to do with a Raspberry Pi? Ever wanted to setup your own cluster? Interested to see how truly cross-platform .NET Core really is? We'll explore creating and deploying serverless functions on something other than AWS or Azure using the OpenFaas (Functions as a Service) framework. OpenFaaS (Functions as a Service) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker and Kubernetes. On a Raspberry Pi cluster with 6 nodes we'll configure Redis, install and configure OpenFaaS, deploy functions written in Python and C#, watch as functions scale up and down under load, and monitor the health of our system using Grafana.```
